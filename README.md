# Classification-and-Feature-Extraction-for-Hydraulic-Structures-Data-Using-Advanced-CNN-Architectures

This project of the paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9565622). You can find the implentation of the main four models  in this paper as follows:
- Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs),
- Capsule Networks (CapsNets),
- Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs),
- Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN) for augmentation data.
- also some traditional Machine Learning (ML) classifies.
